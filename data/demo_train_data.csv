NCT04167371,"Background. Rumination syndrome is characterized by effortless recurrent regurgitation of recently ingested food into the mouth, with consequent expulsion or re-chewing and swallowing. In a previous study we showed that rumination is produced by an unperceived, somatic response to food ingestion. We developed an original biofeedback technique based on electromyography-guided control of abdominothoracic muscular activity. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial we demonstrated the superiority of biofeedback over placebo for the treatment of rumination. However, the technique is technically complex and unpractical.~Aim. To prove the efficacy of a simplified biofeedback technique for the treatment of rumination. Selection criteria. Rumination after meal ingestion. Intervention. Patients will be randomized into biofeedback in placebo groups. Three sessions of either biofeedback or placebo intervention will be performed after ingestion of a probe meal during the first 3 weeks of the 4 weeks intervention period.~Biofeedback: patients will be taught to control abdominal and thoracic muscular activity by providing a visual display of the abdominal and thoracic perimeter; patients will be instructed to perform the same exercises before and after breakfast, lunch and dinner during the 4-week intervention period.~Placebo: abdominal and thoracic perimeter will be recorded but not shown to the patient and a pill of placebo containing 0.5 g glucose will be administered; patients will be instructed to take a pill of placebo before breakfast, lunch and dinner during the 4-week intervention period.~Primary Outcome Measure:~Number of rumination events measured by electromyography in response to the challenge meal before and after treatment.~Secondary Outcome Measures:~* Number of self perceived rumination events measured by questionnaires administered daily for 10 days will before and after treatment.~* Associated abdominal symptom measured by questionnaires administered daily for 10 days before and after treatment.~* Follow up: number of self perceived rumination events measured at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment.",Treament of Rumination,Biofeedback,Rumination Disorders,Not Available,"Number of rumination events after a challenge meal measured by electromyography, Rumination events will be identified by recording the activity of the thoraco abdominal muscles (intercostals, external oblique, internal oblique, upper rectus, lower rectus) by electromyography after a challenge meal.

NCT01645722,"The objective of this pilot study is to assess the efficacy of minimally invasive autologous fat transfers at the amputation sites and the modulation of pain at the respective sites. Our investigators hypothesize that autologous fat grafting can provide a minimally invasive therapy to effectively mitigate pain syndromes at amputation sites, by introducing volume stable subcutaneous tissue over bony prominences and peripheral nerve trunks, thereby avoiding major surgical revisions and preserving limb length. The investigators further hypothesize that enriching the fat graft with autologous adipose stromal cells, a regenerative medicine approach, will lead to improved retention of the fat graft over time and result in a more favorable outcome.~The Investigators will evaluate:~1. Treatment of painful amputation sites in 5 patients with fat grafting, intended to provide additional subcutaneous tissue padding over bony structures and nerve trunks. Limb anatomy and healing of the graft over time, along with stability/persistence of the new tissue, will be assessed by high resolution CT scanning with 3D reconstruction. Patients will be followed for 24 months after treatment to define long term outcomes. Patients will be enrolled who have pain at an amputation site that limits function and/or interferes with the ability to use a prosthesis.~2. Biologic properties of the cells within the fat graft and correlate with clinical outcomes. This will include adipose stem cell yield per volume of fat tissue, cell proliferation, capacity for adipogenic differentiation, lipolysis, and cell sub-population analysis by multiparameter flow cytometry. Results of these assays will be correlated with graft volume retention to search for predictors of good clinical outcome that are related to variation on adipose biology between subjects.~3.

NCT03593941,"This research project will address a desperate need for evidence on how diet could be used to treat and improve symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been estimated that 36 million people have dementia worldwide, and in older people Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-70% of all dementia. Research supports the hypothesis that modifiable lifestyle-related factors are associated with cognitive decline, which opens new avenues for prevention or modification of disease.~The concept that inspires this proposal 'Ageing-Gut-Brain Interactions study' is that the gut microbiota impact upon the gut-brain axis and thereby on behaviour, including challenging behaviours often associated with dementia. In the absence of available cures for Alzheimer's disease, diet is an important modifiable component but knowledge about the role of diet in clinical symptoms of dementia is currently very limited. A recent study from Ireland from the European Union funded Nu-Age cohort reported that the gut microbiota profile in the elderly was different between community-living and institutionalized individuals, with specific microbiome profiles correlating with frailty and poor health.~Changes in dietary composition and diversity were considered the main drivers of the shifts in gut bacteria profile. In this multi-disciplinary research study, the investigators will assess the gut microbiota composition in people with Alzheimer's dementia with and without challenging behaviours; test the feasibility of recruitment; and provide initial data to support a future grant application involving a dietary intervention study in patients with Alzheimer's disease.~The investigators will test the hypothesis that the gut-brain axis promotes behavioural changes in Alzheimer's dementia and is responsive to changes in gut microbiota profile, by comparing the gut microbiota profile between three participant groups (1) Alzheimer's dementia with challenging behaviour, (2) Alzheimer's dementia without challenging behaviour, and (3) a control group of healthy age-matched elderly.
